I use Jupiter notebook for this assignment. My report is included in the notebook file therefore there is no extra report file.

To run Jupiter notebook you should;

1. Install python3
2. Run the command "pip3 install numpy jupyter" to install necessary libraries.
3. After that navigate the folder that include this file in terminal and run the command "jupyter notebook"
4. From the page opened select and open the file named "Contig Generator.ipynb"

All the codes report and the outputs of the code is inside the notebook file. Additionally I printed all of outputs to text file which are in this directory.
